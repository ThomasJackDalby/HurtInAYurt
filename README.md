# HurtInAYurt

Like Hell in a Cell, only in a Yurt
Top Down multiplayer shooter.

## Setup

First off, clone this repo locally:

```
git clone https:
```

Second, you need to install the packages. NPM makes this easy with:

```
npm install
```

Finally, start the node server.
```
node app.js 8000
```

## Controls

Once connected to the game, you'll see yourself, a bad-ass shooter, who can only move in a 2D plane. Yeah things have gotten rough lately...
