# HurtInAYurt

Like Hell in a Cell, only in a Yurt

Hurt in a Yurt is a simple game pulled together at a "yurtathon" in 2017.

It's a turn based strategy game, requiring a balance between managing resources, and attacking foes.

The key game mechanic is in the placing of units, and the building of damage patterns which your units can inflict. In traditional games, these are fixed based on the unit type, but in HurtInAYurt, these are built based upon the customisations done to a unit.

Maps are rectangular grids, with cells either blocking line or sight, or not.

You can view enemy damage patterns for enemies that you can see.

## Game mechanics

1) Load a turn. 
2) Apply actions. UI renders up to latest item.
3) Everything is deterministic? Can forward/rewind.
4) Save out end state, so can send to other player.
